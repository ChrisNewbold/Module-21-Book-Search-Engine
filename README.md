## My Task

- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

- Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

- Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

- Deploy the application to Heroku.
